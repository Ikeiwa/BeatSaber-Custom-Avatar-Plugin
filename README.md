# Custom Avatar Plugin

Plugin for Beat Saber to import custom avatars with IK support.

## Installing

### Automatic

Use the [mod installer][0].

It is the easiest method, it will do all these steps below in 1 click.

### Manual

1. Make sure that Beat Saber is not running.
2. Extract the contents of the zip into Beat Saber's installation folder.
3. Done! You've installed the Custom Avatar Plugin.

**Note:**
The installation folder is the folder that contains `Beat Saber.exe`.

For Oculus Home: `\Oculus Apps\Software\hyperbolic-magnetism-beat-saber\`

For Steam: `\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\`

## Usage

To add new avatars, find a `.avatar` file (most are in this [Discord server][2]) and put them in the `CustomAvatars` folder.

To switch between avatars, press <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd>.

You can only see custom avatars with a third person camera, which you can get with [CameraPlus][1].
